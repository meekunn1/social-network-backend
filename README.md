# Social-Network-Backend

## Description

This is a back end for a simple social media app. Through this project, I was able to learn and practice using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) data base though the use of [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose). I was also able to improve my usage of [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

This is only a backend setup so please use Insomnia. Go to terminal, check that you are in the same directory as the package.json file, and run "npm start" to start up the server. Once server is started, go to your Insomnia.
